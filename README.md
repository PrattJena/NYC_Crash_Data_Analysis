# NYC Traffic Collision Analysis

This project conducts a data-driven analysis of NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions, identifying accident trends, high-risk areas, and contributing factors. By leveraging statistical and geospatial techniques, the study aims to provide actionable insights for traffic safety and urban planning.

## Project Overview

This analysis focuses on traffic collision patterns in Brooklyn (2019-2020), using accident data from the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95). The project examines collision frequencies, accident hotspots, and key risk factors to aid in data-driven decision-making.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Standardizes and organizes raw traffic data for analysis.  
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Visualizes accident hotspots using Folium and Matplotlib.  
- **Trend Identification**: Analyzes temporal patterns in accident rates and contributing factors.  
- **Interactive Insights**: Implements visual tools for enhanced data interpretation.  

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for data processing and analysis.  
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and preprocessing.  
- **Folium**: Geospatial visualization of accident locations.  
- **Matplotlib**: Statistical trend analysis and visual representation.  

## Results and Insights

- **Hotspot Identification**: Detects high-incident areas for targeted safety interventions.  
- **Temporal Analysis**: Highlights peak accident hours and seasonal fluctuations.  
- **Causal Factors**: Investigates major contributors to accidents for policy recommendations.  

This study provides valuable insights for urban planning, road safety policies, and future data-driven traffic management initiatives.
